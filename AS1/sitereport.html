                <h2>Module experince</h2>
                <p>Overall Web Development has been an exciting journey. I had to work on my own time going through CSS, HTML, JavaScript and going through recorded classes and lessons had helped me want to code a lot more independently. While trying to also branch into new ways to better my portfolio, I found languages I was not yet introduce to like, Malbolge and LISP which are completely out of my league. My biggest problem with coding in the beginning was always tags and what tag does what, so I followed this with testing out tags to see what they could do on a blank interface. After multiple sessions of debugging and running random code, I started my own little projects like fake company websites and fake marketplaces.
					As I had stated before looking back, I would've optimised my use of GitHub repositories to assist me while I was coding, however I did find that VS helped me better than Atom and Sublime. When starting to make my site responsive my biggest issue was dimensions and sizing, what I repeated to myself when I stared was Desktop Over and Mobile under, which was me trying to remember that a desktop is usually over 1000px wide while a mobile device is under. I have made sure to review recorded classes to continue to make sure that I can maximise my output and potential in website development, while of reflecting on the course I have also made sure to include animations, layouts and more on my revision list
					
					Although I did feel as I made a lot of progress this year, I did have trouble with deadlines, even when I tried to start a task as early as I could, Iâ€™d run into problems that would hinder my overall progress with this course mainly. However I had began to enjoy this course a lot more than I thought I would have, also due to the help of Chris.
