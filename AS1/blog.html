                    <h2>First Drafts</h2>
                    <p>For my project I had multiple draft ideas that ideas different, colourways, backgrounds, layouts that I wanted to include for my portfolio, however I shouldv'e began with the set up of my GitHub and making repositories for my drafts, as I unfortunately made my GitHub a bit later I was not able to show some of the comments and adjustments I had made to my potfolio, loooking back I can tell this was one of my biggest mistakes. Since setting up my GitHub I was introduced to how it links to my Visual Studio app and copys the coding simultaniously, almost as if an autosave.</p>

                    <h2>Set Up</h2>
                    <p>I had quite a range of drafts colourways to choose from but blue and white were my obvious options, from then I began my introducing the 5 diffent webpages which with Hypertext Refrences, these woudl like all my pages with one another but, I had not made any pages yet. I had then set up the rest of my index page and included an, about me column that would be used in the future as it was not a requirement for the task. </p>

                <div class="blog-box">
                    <h2>Hiccups and Errors</h2>
                    <p>While coding the rest of my pages I ran in to quite a lot of errors, including incorrect syntax selectors and mulitple spelling erros that would effect colours dimensions on the webpage. For me to make my site responsive I ensured to review all my code regulary and often get help from students about margins and padding</p>
